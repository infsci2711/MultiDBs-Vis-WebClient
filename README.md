The WebClient is the user interface of this project. On the interface, users are able to create new accounts and log in to the system. After logging in, each user can create new canvases or search canvases by name or delete canvases. After creating canvases, users should be able to create a new story to add targeted datasets. After adding targeted datasets into the story, users are able to visualize the data. 

On the interface, there are buttons for managing canvases, buttons for managing stories and buttons for managing charts.
